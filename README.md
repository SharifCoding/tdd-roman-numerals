# Coding Kata - Roman Numerals - TDD
![](./img/generate1to8.png)
Creating a function that converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent using TDD (Test-driven Development) approach. Particularly interested in the following:
- Code quality
- Code readability
- Testing (TDD approach)

Write a class that implements the following interface (example given in Java/JavaScript):
```java
public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {
    public String generate(int number);
    }
```
```js
class RomanNumeralGenerator {
  constructor(number) {
    this.number = number;
  }
  generate() {
  }
};
```
Only support numbers between 1 and 3999 and see the following sample inputs and outputs:
```bash
1 = “I”,
5 = “V”,
10 = “X”,
20 = “XX”,
3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”.
```

#### Built with
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node Package Manager
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - JavaScript Testing Framework
* [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) - Updates the browser on changes
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Convert JSX syntax and strip out type annotations

#### Installation
To run this project you will need to download it onto your local machine and install all dependencies.
Navigate inside the folder and enter the following command on your terminal window:
```bash
# install all dependencies
npm install
# run the test
npm test
```

### Approach
<b>First Stage:</b> Used a [boilerplate](https://github.com/MCRcodes/react-bootstrap.git) which already has Jest test framework set up for ES6 with Babel solving any compatibility issue. Created a unit tests to check both `RomanNumeralGenerator` function and `number` property are functioning correctly. And created a simple function currently returning `I` number value.

<b>Second Stage:</b> Tidied up test units for the constructor, and also support for numbers between 1 and 5. The function itself has been expanded to support number value up to 5, resulting in all passes for the test units.

<b>Third Stage:</b> Refactor both the test units and the `RomanNumeralGenerator` function which include replacing multiple if statements for value between 1 to 3 with one if statement since these value only uses one character `I`.
